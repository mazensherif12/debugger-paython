# Python Debugger Project

## Introduction
This project implements a custom Python debugger that allows users to:
- Set breakpoints in a Python script.
- Monitor variables during execution.

## Features
- Line-by-line debugging.
- Variable watching for runtime analysis.
- Integration with Pylint for code quality and Pytest for testing.

## How to Use
1. Add your script to debug (e.g., `test_script.py`).
2. Use `Debugger` to set breakpoints and watch variables.
   Example:
   ```python
   from debugger import Debugger

   debugger = Debugger("test_script.py")
   debugger.set_breakpoint(10)
   debugger.watch_variable("total")
   debugger.run()
